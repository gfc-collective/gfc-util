/**
 * Used to rate-limit calls to a work function, e.g. that writes to a db.
 *
 * Note you can disable the rate limiter by setting the frequency to 0.
 *
 * The math is as follows (mod some conversions between seconds and nano-seconds):
 *
 * After n samples, we can computer Ri as the "immediate rate" like:
 *
 *    Ri = (n-1) / (timestamp(n) - timestamp(0))
 *
 * which is essentially the 1/average interval.
 *
 * Given a target rate, Rt ("maxFreqHz"), we can compute it like:
 *
 *    Rt = n / (S + (timestamp(n) - timestamp(0))
 *
 * S here is how long to sleep before we invoke the next operation.  Solving for S:
 *
 *    S = n / Rt - (timestamp(n) - timestamp(0))
 *
 * @param maxFreqHz Frequency the system should strive to achieve on average. Not a guarantee
